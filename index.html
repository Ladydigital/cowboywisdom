    <div class="description">
      <p> The Lone Rangers Code
        <ul>
          <li>I believe that to have a friend, a man must be one.</li>
          <li>That all men are created equal and that everyone has within himself the power to make this a better world.</li>
          <li>That God put the firewood there, but that every man must gather and light it himself.</li>
          <li>In being prepared physically, mentally, and morally to fight when necessary for that which is right.</li>
          <li>That a man should make the most of what equipment he has.</li>
          <li>That "this government, of the people, by the people, and for the people," shall live always.</li>
          <li>That men should live by the rule of what is best for the greatest number.</li>
          <li>That sooner or later...somewhere...somehow...we must settle with the world and make payment for what we have taken.</li>
          <li>That all things change, but the truth, and the truth alone lives on forever.</li>
          <li>I believe in my Creator, my country, my fellow man.</li>
